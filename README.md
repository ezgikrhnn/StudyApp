Here is my Core Data Study Application

💜 You can add and edit the tasks you need to do during the day on the ToDo List screen. 

⏰ On the Sets screen, you can add all the sets you will work on that day in hours and start a separate timer for each. Your timer will warn you when your time is up.

🧘🏻‍♀️ I am still working on the meditation screen of my application.

✅ I used Core Data while doing my work. Other structures I use:
- TableView
- DatePicker
- Data transfer between pages
